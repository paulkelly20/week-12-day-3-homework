Option 1: BrewDog API
Tasks
Make an XMLHttpRequest to get data on BrewDog beers back from this API: https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers

The API can occasionally be unreliable, here's an alternate url - https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/brewdogapi/beers.json

Display a list of the names of the beers

try to use small, reuseable functions
for example, one to handle looping through all the data, then using a separate function to create and render each item into the list
Add an <img> to each beer

there is an "image_url" key on the beer objects we get back from the API
Extensions
Create a drop down which allows the user to select a single beer
Upon selecting a beer, the following should appear for each the selected beer: name, image, and description
